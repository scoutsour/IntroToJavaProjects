/**
 * This project was inspired by word jumbles. The program randomly chooses a
 * word from a dictionary, scrambles the letters, and lets the user guess the
 * unscrambled word. After every incorrect guess, part of the unscrambled word
 * is shown. The number of points earned for a correct guess decreases with the
 * number of guesses.
